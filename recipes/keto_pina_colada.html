        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk (120 ml/ 4 fl oz)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup coconut water (60 ml/ 2 fl oz) or water (+ ice)</li>
            <li>1 shot dark or white rum (1 1/2 fl oz)</li>
            <li>1 slice fresh pineapple (28 g/ 1 oz)</li>
            <li>3-5 drops liquid Stevia extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you start making your cocktail, you will need to freeze the coconut water for 1-2 hours in an ice cube tray. Alternatively, you can use regular water and add fresh coconut water directly into the drink.
               </li>
            <li>Place the pineapple and coconut milk into a blender and pulse until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place the "coconut water ice cubes" into a glass, add rum and pour the blended mixture into a glass. You can optionally place the glass in the freezer for 20 minutes. This will keep the drink cool.
               </li>
            <li>You can even use a cocktail shaker to create a bit of foam on the top. Just place the ice, coconut milk mixture and rum in and shake well.
               </li>
            <li>Garnish with a slice of fresh pineapple and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
